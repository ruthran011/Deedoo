            Deedoo is the open source platform that lets you build the perfect education solution for your needs.<br>        </p>
        <p id="para_2">
            We’ve grown Deedoo since 2016 as a free platform for educators to develop and manage courses online.<br><br>
            Deedoo is a modular system based on plugins, which are like lego blocks that you put together to build whatever you want.
            There are plugins for different kinds of content, and plugins for all kinds of collaborative activities, which is where
            Deedoo really shines.  As an example our Workshop plugin manages a full peer assessment process, so you can get hundreds of
            students accurately grading each other’s assignments (that can save you a lot of time!).
            Add some tracking and reports and the ability to add more plugins from the community or even ones you write yourself,
            and you can build some pretty amazing education environments.<br><br>
            The Deedoo project is run by Deedoo from Moratuwa, Sri lanka, but would not be what it is without a huge community of users.
            Our community work together and help each other on Deedoo.org (itself a Deedoo site), where they’ve taken Deedoo’s
            founding principles of feedback and collaboration online and practise it in our Deedoo forums, our wiki-based Deedoo
            Documentation, our Deedoo Tracker for bugs and new features, our course-sharing site Deedoo.net, and our Deedoo
            Translation portal.
